# Oil_Production_Analysis

Group project using Html, Tableau, and Machine Learning to tell the story and try to predict the future fluids rates of a few select oil wells, and reservoirs. 

Anaylized the history of the production of the wells and reservoirs to see the production of oil, gas, and water over time to try to predict using Machine Learning what the prduction of each well and reservoir would be for the future.

## The data
  Location data for each well
  Historical production of oil, water and gas for each well
  Historical pressures in some wells allow to build a average behaviour for each reservoir
  Petrophisical summary
